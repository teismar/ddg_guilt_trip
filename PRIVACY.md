# Privacy Policy for DDG Guilt Trip

**Last updated: January 9, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how DDG Guilt Trip ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, transmit, store, or sell any of your personal data.**

Everything happens locally on your device.

### Web History & Navigation
The extension uses the `webNavigation` permission to detect when you navigate to specific URLs (specifically DuckDuckGo). This process happens entirely within your browser. No URLs or search queries are sent to us or any third-party servers.

### Settings & Statistics
Your preferences (e.g., enabled bangs, strict mode) and usage statistics (e.g., number of redirects avoided) are stored in your browser's local storage (`browser.storage.local`). This data never leaves your device.

## Third-Party Services
When the extension redirects you to a privacy-friendly alternative (like Piped or Wikiless), you are visiting a third-party website. These websites have their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for their practices.

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy, you can open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/teismar/ddg_guilt_trip).
